## **Objectives**

The goal of better understanding the software design process through this project will take place in a multitude of different ways:
- Creating a Design Document of the desired Views and software architecture
    - A Design Document indicating the end goals of the project along with the software architecture helps to give direction to this project. It works as a general guideline to help people new and old to understand the inner-workings of this project and the overall intent and design choices made
- Use of Test Driven Development
    - TDD requires writing and updating tests for every feature implemented and bug fixed. This forces us to have a good understanding of the requirements needed to complete the intended objective before writing code. Additionally, unit tests are a great documentation tool that tell us how certain functionality is expected to be used 
- Writing of Unit/Integration/GUI tests
    - Testing is an important part of writing good working code. Unit tests provides great documentation while also ensuring code works as expected
- Employing OOP Design Patterns and SOLID Principles
    - Design patterns and SOLID principles allow for a clean consistent design of code structure. These principles and patterns give us more maintainable and modular code
- Beginning with Minimum Viable Product(MVP)
    - Starting with MVP gets something visible displayed instead of just having a theoretical model in design documents. MVP gives a skeleton to work off of and iterate on further in the future
- Write Clean Code
    - Clean Code is one of the major steps to writing good code as it makes it easier to understand and read parts of code for all developers. Clean code helps to understand what the code is doing and why the code is doing it.
